# GitHub Explorer Architecture Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the architectural decisions, design patterns, and technology choices made in the GitHub Explorer application.

## Architectural Overview

The GitHub Explorer application follows a feature-based architecture with clear separation of concerns. The codebase is organized into core functionality (reusable components, utilities, and hooks) and feature modules (domain-specific implementations).

### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Feature-Based Organization**: Code is structured by domain features rather than technical patterns.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Distinct boundaries between UI components, business logic, and data access.
3. **Custom Hook Pattern**: Complex logic is encapsulated in custom hooks for reusability and testability.
4. **Context API for Global State**: Global state like favorites is managed using React Context.
5. **Service Layer Pattern**: API interactions are abstracted through service classes.

      /context     # Favorites Context API implementation
  /pages           # Next.js pages
  /styles          # Global styles
  /__tests__       # Test files
```

## Core Systems

### API Client System

The API client system provides a robust foundation for interacting with external APIs:

- **ApiClient Class**: A configurable class for making HTTP requests with error handling
- **Token Management**: Automatic handling of authentication tokens from localStorage or environment variables
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with retry strategies and fallbacks

```typescript
// Example usage of API Client
const apiClient = new ApiClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://api.github.com',
  tokenProvider: () => localStorage.getItem('github_token') || null,
  onError: (error, endpoint) => console.error(`API Error (${endpoint}):`, error)
});

const userData = await apiClient.get('/users/octocat');
```

### Caching System

The caching system improves performance and reduces API calls:

- **In-Memory Cache**: Temporary storage of API responses
- **Time-Based Expiration**: Automatic invalidation of cached data after a configurable time period
- **Capacity Management**: Prevents memory leaks by limiting cache size and removing oldest entries
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Background cleanup process to remove expired entries

```typescript
// Example usage of Cache System
const cache = useGithubCache();

// Try to get from cache first
const cachedData = cache.getCachedData<User[]>('users_list');
if (cachedData) {
  return cachedData;
}

// Fetch fresh data and cache it
const freshData = await fetchUsers();
cache.setCachedData('users_list', freshData);
```

### Deduplication System

The deduplication system prevents redundant API calls:

- **Request Tracking**: Keeps track of in-flight requests
- **Response Sharing**: Returns the same promise for identical concurrent requests
- **Cooldown Period**: Prevents repeated failing requests
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes completed requests from tracking

```typescript
// Example usage of Deduplication System
const deduplication = useDeduplication();

const result = await deduplication.executeWithDeduplication(
  'search_users_react',
  async () => await githubService.searchUsers('react')
);
```

### Retry Strategy

The retry strategy improves reliability when API calls fail:

- **Exponential Backoff**: Increases wait time between retry attempts
- **Configurable Attempts**: Customizable number of retry attempts
- **Error Tracking**: Keeps track of errors for user feedback
- **Callback Hooks**: Supports callbacks for logging or notification

```typescript
// Example usage of Retry Strategy
const retryStrategy = useRetryStrategy({
  maxRetryAttempts: 3,
  onRetry: (attempt, error, backoffTime) => {
    // Log or notify about retry
  }
});

try {
  await fetchData();
} catch (error) {
  retryStrategy.handleError(error);
}
```

## Feature Implementations

### User Management

The user management feature handles user search, display, and pagination:

- **User Search**: Implements debounced search with caching
- **Pagination**: Custom pagination with infinite scrolling support
- **User Details**: Fetches and displays detailed user information
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API limits and errors

### Favorites System

The favorites system allows users to save and manage favorite GitHub profiles:

- **Context-Based State**: Global state for favorites accessible throughout the app
- **Local Storage**: Persistence of favorites between sessions
- **Synchronization**: Automatic updating of favorite status across the application

## Testing Strategy

The application follows a comprehensive testing strategy:

- **Unit Testing**: Individual components and hooks are tested in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: Key interactions between components are tested
- **Mock Services**: External dependencies are mocked for reliable testing
- **Test Coverage**: Maintains high code coverage (>95%)

## Performance Optimizations

- **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Debouncing**: Input debouncing to reduce API calls during typing
- **Code Splitting**: Dynamic imports for smaller initial bundle size
- **Image Optimization**: Optimized image loading with Next.js Image component
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Pre-rendering of detailed user pages for faster load times

## Security Considerations

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in environment variables
- **Input Sanitization**: User inputs are sanitized before use in API calls
- **Token Handling**: API tokens are stored securely and never exposed to clients
- **Error Message Security**: Careful handling of error messages to prevent information leakage

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:

1. **State Management Evolution**: Consider more sophisticated state management for larger scale
2. **Offline Support**: Enhanced offline capabilities with service workers
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add real-time performance monitoring
4. **Internationalization**: Add support for multiple languages
5. **Accessibility Improvements**: Enhanced accessibility features
